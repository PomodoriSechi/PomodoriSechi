- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PomodoriSechi
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game development
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to not freak out with learning how to code
- ğŸŒˆI have my background in Design and am experienced in many No- and Low code tools...
- ...which is why I am a bit of a noob when it comes to actual coding
- ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­ I'm based in the land of chocolate & cheesse
